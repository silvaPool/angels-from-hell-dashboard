        <Typography class="text">
          Edgar Allan Poe’s stature as a major figure in world literature is
          primarily based on his ingenious and profound short stories, poems,
          and critical theories, which established a highly influential
          rationale for the short form in both poetry and fiction. Regarded in
          literary histories and handbooks as the architect of the modern short
          story, Poe was also the principal forerunner of the “art for art’s
          sake” movement in 19th-century European literature. Whereas earlier
          critics predominantly concerned themselves with moral or ideological
          generalities, Poe focused his criticism on the specifics of style and
          construction that contributed to a work’s effectiveness or failure. In
          his own work, he demonstrated a brilliant command of language and
          technique as well as an inspired and original imagination. Poe’s
          poetry and short stories greatly influenced the French Symbolists of
          the late 19th century, who in turn altered the direction of modern
          literature.

          Poe’s father and mother were professional actors. At the time of his
          birth in 1809, they were members of a repertory company in Boston.
          Before Poe was three years old both of his parents died, and he was
          raised in the home of John Allan, a prosperous exporter from Richmond,
          Virginia, who never legally adopted his foster son. As a boy, Poe
          attended the best schools available, and was admitted to the
          University of Virginia at Charlottesville in 1825. While there he
          distinguished himself academically but was forced to leave after less
          than a year because of bad debts and inadequate financial support from
          Allan. Poe’s relationship with Allan disintegrated upon his return to
          Richmond in 1827, and soon after Poe left for Boston, where he
          enlisted in the army and also published his first poetry collection,
          Tamerlane, and Other Poems. The volume went unnoticed by readers and
          reviewers, and a second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor
          Poems, received only slightly more attention when it appeared in 1829.
          That same year Poe was honorably discharged from the army, having
          attained the rank of regimental sergeant major, and was then admitted
          to the United States Military Academy at West Point. However, because
          Allan would neither provide his foster son with sufficient funds to
          maintain himself as a cadet nor give the consent necessary to resign
          from the Academy, Poe gained a dismissal by ignoring his duties and
          violating regulations. He subsequently went to New York City, where
          Poems, his third collection of verse, was published in 1831, and then
          to Baltimore, where he lived at the home of his aunt, Mrs. Maria
          Clemm. Over the next few years Poe’s first short stories appeared in
          the Philadelphia Saturday Courier and his “MS. Found in a Bottle” won
          a cash prize for best story in the Baltimore Saturday Visitor.
          Nevertheless, Poe was still not earning enough to live independently,
          nor did Allan’s death in 1834 provide him with an inheritance. The
          following year, however, his financial problems were temporarily
          alleviated when he accepted an editorship at The Southern Literary
          Messenger in Richmond, bringing with him his aunt and his 12-year-old
          cousin Virginia, whom he married in 1836. The Southern Literary
          Messenger was the first of several journals Poe would direct over the
          next 10 years and through which he rose to prominence as a leading man
          of letters in America. Poe made himself known not only as a
          superlative author of poetry and fiction, but also as a literary
          critic whose level of imagination and insight had hitherto been
          unapproached in American literature. While Poe’s writings gained
          attention in the late 1830s and early 1840s, the profits from his work
          remained meager, and he supported himself by editing Burton’s
          Gentleman’s Magazine and Graham’s Magazine in Philadelphia and the
          Broadway Journal in New York City. After his wife’s death from
          tuberculosis in 1847, Poe became involved in a number of romantic
          affairs. It was while he prepared for his second marriage that Poe,
          for reasons unknown, arrived in Baltimore in late September of 1849.
          On October 3, he was discovered in a state of semi-consciousness; he
          died four days later without regaining the necessary lucidity to
          explain what had happened during the last days of his life. Poe’s most
          conspicuous contribution to world literature derives from the
          analytical method he practiced both as a creative author and as a
          critic of the works of his contemporaries. His self-declared intention
          was to formulate strictly artistic ideals in a milieu that he thought
          overly concerned with the utilitarian value of literature, a tendency
          he termed the “heresy of the Didactic.” While Poe’s position includes
          the chief requisites of pure aestheticism, his emphasis on literary
          formalism was directly linked to his philosophical ideals: through the
          calculated use of language one may express, though always imperfectly,
          a vision of truth and the essential condition of human existence.
          Poe’s theory of literary creation is noted for two central points:
          first, a work must create a unity of effect on the reader to be
          considered successful; second, the production of this single effect
          should not be left to the hazards of accident or inspiration, but
          should to the minutest detail of style and subject be the result of
          rational deliberation on the part of the author. In poetry, this
          single effect must arouse the reader’s sense of beauty, an ideal that
          Poe closely associated with sadness, strangeness, and loss; in prose,
          the effect should be one revelatory of some truth, as in “tales of
          ratiocination” or works evoking “terror, or passion, or horror.” Aside
          from a common theoretical basis, there is a psychological intensity
          that is characteristic of Poe’s writings, especially the tales of
          horror that comprise his best and best-known works. These
          stories—which include “The Black Cat,” “The Cask of Amontillado,” and
          “The Tell-Tale Heart”—are often told by a first-person narrator, and
          through this voice Poe probes the workings of a character’s psyche.
          This technique foreshadows the psychological explorations of Fyodor
          Dostoyevsky and the school of psychological realism. In his Gothic
          tales, Poe also employed an essentially symbolic, almost allegorical
          method which gives such works as “The Fall of the House of Usher,”
          “The Masque of the Red Death,” and “Ligeia” an enigmatic quality that
          accounts for their enduring interest and links them with the
          symbolical works of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville. The
          influence of Poe’s tales may be seen in the work of later writers,
          including Ambrose Bierce and H.P. Lovecraft, who belong to a distinct
          tradition of horror literature initiated by Poe. In addition to his
          achievement as creator of the modern horror tale, Poe is also credited
          with parenting two other popular genres: science fiction and the
          detective story. In such works as “The Unparalleled Adventure of Hans
          Pfaall” and “Von Kempelen and His Discovery,” Poe took advantage of
          the fascination for science and technology that emerged in the early
          19th century to produce speculative and fantastic narratives which
          anticipate a type of literature that did not become widely practiced
          until the 20th century. Similarly, Poe’s three tales of
          ratiocination—“The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Purloined Letter,”
          and “The Mystery of Marie Roget”—are recognized as the models which
          established the major characters and literary conventions of detective
          fiction, specifically the amateur sleuth who solves a crime that has
          confounded the authorities and whose feats of deductive reasoning are
          documented by an admiring associate. Just as Poe influenced many
          succeeding authors and is regarded as an ancestor of such major
          literary movements as Symbolism and Surrealism, he was also influenced
          by earlier literary figures and movements. In his use of the demonic
          and the grotesque, Poe evidenced the impact of the stories of E.T.A.
          Hoffman and the Gothic novels of Ann Radcliffe, while the despair and
          melancholy in much of his writing reflects an affinity with the
          Romantic movement of the early 19th century. It was Poe’s particular
          genius that in his work he gave consummate artistic form both to his
          personal obsessions and those of previous literary generations, at the
          same time creating new forms which provided a means of expression for
          future artists. While Poe is most often remembered for his short
          fiction, his first love as a writer was poetry, which he began writing
          during his adolescence. His early verse reflects the influence of such
          English romantics as Lord Byron, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley,
          yet foreshadows his later poetry which demonstrates a subjective
          outlook and surreal, mystic vision. “Tamerlane” and “Al Aaraaf”
          exemplify Poe’s evolution from the portrayal of Byronic heroes to the
          depiction of journeys within his own imagination and subconscious. The
          former piece, reminiscent of Byron’s “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage,”
          recounts the life and adventures of a 14th-century Mongol conqueror;
          the latter poem portrays a dreamworld where neither good nor evil
          permanently reside and where absolute beauty can be directly
          discerned. In other poems—“To Helen,” “Lenore,” and “The Raven” in
          particular—Poe investigates the loss of ideal beauty and the
          difficulty in regaining it. These pieces are usually narrated by a
          young man who laments the untimely death of his beloved. “To Helen” is
          a three stanza lyric that has been called one of the most beautiful
          love poems in the English language. The subject of the work is a woman
          who becomes, in the eyes of the narrator, a personification of the
          classical beauty of ancient Greece and Rome. “Lenore” presents ways in
          which the dead are best remembered, either by mourning or celebrating
          life beyond earthly boundaries. In “The Raven,” Poe successfully
          unites his philosophical and aesthetic ideals. In this psychological
          piece, a young scholar is emotionally tormented by a raven’s ominous
          repetition of “Nevermore” in answer to his question about the
          probability of an afterlife with his deceased lover. Charles
          Baudelaire noted in his introduction to the French edition of “The
          Raven”: “It is indeed the poem of the sleeplessness of despair; it
          lacks nothing: neither the fever of ideas, nor the violence of colors,
          nor sickly reasoning, nor drivelling terror, nor even the bizarre
          gaiety of suffering which makes it more terrible.” Poe also wrote
          poems that were intended to be read aloud. Experimenting with
          combinations of sound and rhythm, he employed such technical devices
          as repetition, parallelism, internal rhyme, alliteration, and
          assonance to produce works that are unique in American poetry for
          their haunting, musical quality. In “The Bells,” for example, the
          repetition of the word “bells” in various structures accentuates the
          unique tonality of the different types of bells described in the poem.
          While his works were not conspicuously acclaimed during his lifetime,
          Poe did earn due respect as a gifted fiction writer, poet, and man of
          letters, and occasionally he achieved a measure of popular success,
          especially following the appearance of “The Raven.” After his death,
          however, the history of his critical reception becomes one of
          dramatically uneven judgments and interpretations. This state of
          affairs was initiated by Poe’s one-time friend and literary executor
          R.W. Griswold, who, in a libelous obituary notice in the New York
          Tribune bearing the byline “Ludwig,” attributed the depravity and
          psychological aberrations of many of the characters in Poe’s fiction
          to Poe himself. In retrospect, Griswold’s vilifications seem
          ultimately to have elicited as much sympathy as censure with respect
          to Poe and his work, leading subsequent biographers of the late 19th
          century to defend, sometimes too devotedly, Poe’s name. It was not
          until the 1941 biography by A.H. Quinn that a balanced view was
          provided of Poe, his work, and the relationship between the author’s
          life and his imagination. Nevertheless, the identification of Poe with
          the murderers and madmen of his works survived and flourished in the
          20th century, most prominently in the form of psychoanalytical studies
          such as those of Marie Bonaparte and Joseph Wood Krutch. Added to the
          controversy over the sanity, or at best the maturity of Poe (Paul
          Elmer More called him “the poet of unripe boys and unsound men”), was
          the question of the value of Poe’s works as serious literature. At the
          forefront of Poe’s detractors were such eminent figures as Henry
          James, Aldous Huxley, and T.S. Eliot, who dismissed Poe’s works as
          juvenile, vulgar, and artistically debased; in contrast, these same
          works have been judged to be of the highest literary merit by such
          writers as Bernard Shaw and William Carlos Williams. Complementing
          Poe’s erratic reputation among English and American critics is the
          more stable, and generally more elevated opinion of critics elsewhere
          in the world, particularly in France. Following the extensive
          translations and commentaries of Charles Baudelaire in the 1850s,
          Poe’s works were received with a peculiar esteem by French writers,
          most profoundly those associated with the late 19th-century movement
          of Symbolism, who admired Poe’s transcendent aspirations as a poet;
          the 20th-century movement of Surrealism, which valued Poe’s bizarre
          and apparently unruled imagination; and such figures as Paul Valéry,
          who found in Poe’s theories and thought an ideal of supreme
          rationalism. In other countries, Poe’s works have enjoyed a similar
          regard, and numerous studies have been written tracing the influence
          of the American author on the international literary scene, especially
          in Russia, Japan, Scandinavia, and Latin America. Today, Poe is
          recognized as one of the foremost progenitors of modern literature,
          both in its popular forms, such as horror and detective fiction, and
          in its more complex and self-conscious forms, which represent the
          essential artistic manner of the 20th century. In contrast to earlier
          critics who viewed the man and his works as one, criticism of the past
          25 years has developed a view of Poe as a detached artist who was more
          concerned with displaying his virtuosity than with expressing his
          soul, and who maintained an ironic rather than an autobiographical
          relationship to his writings. While at one time critics such as Yvor
          Winters wished to remove Poe from literary history, his works remain
          integral to any conception of modernism in world literature. Herbert
          Marshall McLuhan wrote in an essay entitled “Edgar Poe’s Tradition”:
          “While the New England dons primly turned the pages of Plato and
          Buddha beside a tea-cozy, and while Browning and Tennyson were
          creating a parochial fog for the English mind to relax in, Poe never
          lost contact with the terrible pathos of his time. Coevally with
          Baudelaire, and long before Conrad and Eliot, he explored the heart of
          darkness.”
